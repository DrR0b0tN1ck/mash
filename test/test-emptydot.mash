#!/usr/bin/env mash

This tests dot() with an empty input.  This case is interesting
because the dot command does not generate any error in this case,
but the resulting image is an empty file, which leads to a
strange-looking error.  Thus, we want to catch the problem in dot(),
instead of when the latex document is compiled.

Correct behavior: Exception raised by dot(), instead of "reading
image file failed" from pdflatex.
